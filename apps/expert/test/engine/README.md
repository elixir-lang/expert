While the Expert application does not depend on Engine as a dependency, and logically Engine should not depend on Expert, we still need to call the Engine from a client like the Expert application in order to test Engine specific functionality. Due to this, this folder with files that don't map to Expert exclusive modules exists. Also for this same reason, Expert does depend on Engine as a test dependency, so we can call Engine functions in tests.
